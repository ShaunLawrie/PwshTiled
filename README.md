# PwshTiled

I had loads of fun yak shaving while preparing for my talk [github.com/ShaunLawrie/PresentingFromIntimidationToInteraction](https://github.com/ShaunLawrie/PresentingFromIntimidationToInteraction)  
Some of this included writing a really rough 2d renderer for sprites walking on a static background which I've dragged out into this repo for people to play with.

I intend to load maps/sprites from [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) with something like https://github.com/TheBoneJarmer/TiledCS.  
Right now I'm just using some images from pokemon to figure out how to render a bit more efficiently.

## Instructions

This is super early, use a small terminal window because it's very slow.
Try run `.\RunVt.ps1` and use arrow keys to navigate.
