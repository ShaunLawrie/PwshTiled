# PwshMon

I had loads of fun yak shaving while preparing for my talk [github.com/ShaunLawrie/PresentingFromIntimidationToInteraction](https://github.com/ShaunLawrie/PresentingFromIntimidationToInteraction)  
Some of this included writing a really rough 2d renderer for sprites walking on a static background which I've dragged out into this repo for people to play with.

## Instructions

1. `Install-Module "PwshTiled" -Scope "CurrentUser"`
2. `Start-PwshTiled`

Use arrow keys to navigate.
